<p style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6; letter-spacing: 0.3px;">
          Hello! I’m a Software Quality Assurance Engineer. I explored computer networking, mobile computing and cloud computing during my undergrad research.
          I co-authored a paper published in the Journal of Cloud Computing.
          My work in these fields has shaped my approach to solving real-world problems through research and innovation.
          <br> <br>
          Currently, I’m transitioning to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), a field that aligns with both my technical background and my growing interest in improving user experiences.
          I aim to contribute to research that bridges the gap between technology and human interaction, focusing on creating intuitive, accessible interfaces and enhancing the usability of software systems.
          <br> <br>
          In the future, I plan to pursue a PhD in HCI, where I hope to continue exploring how user-centric design can drive innovation in software development. <br> <br>
